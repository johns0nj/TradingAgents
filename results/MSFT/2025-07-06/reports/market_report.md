It appears that the tool calls for retrieving the indicator data did not return any values for the specified indicators and date range. This could be due to a technical issue or the data not being available for the requested period.

### Next Steps:
1. **Verify the Data Availability**: Ensure that the data for the specified indicators is available for the given date range (2025-06-06 to 2025-07-06).
2. **Adjust the Look-Back Period**: Try reducing the `look_back_days` parameter to see if the data becomes available for a shorter period.
3. **Check for Errors**: Review the tool's documentation or logs to identify any potential issues with the requests.

Would you like me to proceed with any of these adjustments or explore alternative approaches?
