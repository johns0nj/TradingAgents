Apologies for the inconvenience. It appears that the tool I'm using is currently unable to retrieve the fundamental data for Microsoft (MSFT) due to regional restrictions. 

To proceed, I can manually compile a report based on publicly available information about Microsoft's recent financial performance, insider transactions, and other key metrics. Would you like me to proceed with that approach? Alternatively, if you have access to another tool or data source, I can guide you on how to use it. 

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
